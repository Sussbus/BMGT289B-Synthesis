								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
									I was born on October 1st, 2000, in Chicago, Illinois as the youngest of three boys. As far as I can remember I have always been fascinated by computers and how they worked. Some of my first memories are of me sitting next to my mom watching her use the computer in marvel wondering what it did. It would be from watching my mom work on the computer that I would eventually learn what computers do and how to use them. In middle school, I began to play video games, in particular, a game called Minecraft. Coupled with my curiosity about how computers worked and passion for video games, I eventually began to teach himself how to program extensions to my favorite game at the time, Minecraft. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
									On my fourteenth birthday, I acquired a worker's permit and began working as a bagger in a local grocery store after school. Little did I know, but this job would mark the first of many jobs that I would then go on to work. After months of saving up, I finally had enough money to buy my very first computer, a Macbook Pro. The purchase of that laptop would not only further my passion for programming but also taught me the value of hard work and saving. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
									Fast forward to my freshman year in high school, I decided to join the swim team at my local high school where I would then go on to swim for three years. It wouldn’t take long for my coaches to spot out my talent for breaststroke and fly. I would go on to swim breaststroke or fly nearly every race of my high school career. Waking up at 4:30 AM to go swim in a pool before and after school, not only did I learn to discipline myself, but I would also bond with the people around me and gain some of my most cherished lifelong friends. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
									The summer going into sophomore year of high school, I scored my second-ever job bussing tables at his neighbor's restaurant. Although I did not work there for long, I learned about the day to day challenges of running a business in a competitive industry. On my sixteenth birthday, I acquired my drivers' license and started working as a delivery driver for a small restaurant near his home. As the year went on, I began to teach himself in his spare time how to program mobile and web applications in JavaScript. 
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
									As I entered my senior year of high school, I started to wonder where I wanted to take the next four years of my life. While visiting his cousins in Maryland, Jacob was encouraged to look at the University of Maryland. Upon touring the campus, I instantly fell in love with the campus and positive atmosphere; I knew I had to apply in February. A few months go by after applying and I checked my email, to my surprise I had officially been accepted to the University of Maryland! On August 22nd, 2019 I packaged my bags, said my goodbyes to friends, and boarded a flight to Maryland to start my new life for the next four years.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">	
									In the next semester, I look forward to furthering my knowledge of entrepreneurship and the business world. Although I have taken business-related courses in the past, none have given me any real insight into what it really takes to become successful within the industry you choose to work in. Because I will be studying computer science, I hope that I will learn about how to market myself in order to get a possible internship or future job.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/compsci-stats.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">Since the age of fourteen, when I was legally able to obtain my workers permit, I have been working service and food industry jobs. This has supplied me with a plethora of real-world experiences and encounters where I have to work for and with other people. For each place that I have worked, I have provided an absolute dedication to learning new skills and growing as a person in order to further myself as an asset in the job market. My assets include my savings from my previous jobs, stock investments, my computer, my parents and their networking, and my network of friends and past coworkers. I aspire to live be happy and have stability in my life. I do aspire to make a decent wage, however, this isn’t mandatory. My expectation is to come out of college and have an entry-level job computer science job potentially working at a small to a medium-sized company. I do understand that I still need to make it into the computer science program and once I get in there is no guarantee I will make it to the end. Even then I will still need to make an active effort to get internships during my summers in order to ensure I can get a job coming out of college. People assume that it is extremely easy to find a high paying computer science job coming out of college, however, this is a myth. The reality is that most people find themselves in entry-level jobs that don’t pay well until you have worked several years at a company.</p>

								<h2 class="major">ABZ Plan</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/abz-plan.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<h3>Plan A</h3> Graduate from the University of Maryland with a degree in computer science, move back to Chicago and work for a well-paying computer science job such as a software engineer at a company such as Uptake. Get an apartment downtown, possibly with roommates to save money for a couple of years.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h3>Plan B</h3> Graduate from the University of Maryland or another university with a degree in information science or any computer-related degree. Get a job preferably in the computer field, but potentially in another field that is well paying such as consulting. From, there save up money and make investments for long term stability.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h3>Plan Z</h3> Work a service job or in the food industry at a company like Chipotle. Work at Chipotle for several years until I am promoted to manager at the store I work at or transferred to become a manager at another store. From there I will be making enough money to put aside savings each month for a future down payment on a home or apartment.

							<h3>What are the trends accelerating innovation?</h3>
							<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">The three main trends that are accelerating innovation are market globalization, technology, and climate change. Market globalization is accelerating innovation because more and more countries are starting to develop their economies and produce workers that compete in the global workforce. Moore’s law dictates that every two years or so the number of transistors that can be fit on a chipboard double, thus doubling the amount of potential computing power. Due to this, over the years computers have become more and more powerful and their use cases have broadened allowing individuals to develop technology such as self-driving cars that could potentially put millions of rideshare and truck drivers in the United States lose their jobs. The last main factor that is accelerating innovation is climate change. Climate change is currently forcing millions of people around the world to relocate due to the rising sea level and an increase in ocean temperature. Not long from now, we must completely change the way that we eat, transport ourselves, what products we buy, and how we get our energy. Climate change has lit a fire under scientists forcing them to work around the clock to come up with new innovative ways to save our planet and reduce our waste as a whole.</p>
							<h3>What does it take to innovate?</h3>
							<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">All innovation begins with having the courage to innovate in the first place. After all, innovation is ⅔ nature meaning that anyone can learn and train themselves to do it. One must begin by taking close notice of the world around them and immediately start implementing ideas. In the course of innovation, failure should be expected and shouldn’t push back innovation. Those who have grown to become truly innovative take their failures and not only learn from them but use them as an encouragement to make it across the finish line. Resilience is a must for anyone who wants to achieve a successful innovation as the process of failing and going back to the drawing board can take years and be extremely strenuous. One such innovator who has shown all of these skills is Elon Musk. Musk has had the courage to create his companies in industries that have been shown the past to be extremely tough for competition. Despite this, he has invested both the time and money into creating products that surpass all of his competitors. Each large failure Elon has encountered has only seemed to make him stronger. Elon has even set his sights on colonizing Mars showing that nothing is truly out of reach for this man.</p>
							<h3>How do innovators think?</h3>
							<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">Those who innovate are constantly looking at the world around, questioning, trying to find things that they can associate in order to create unique thoughts and ideas that might be innovative. One such example of this is when Igor Sikorsky was able to think of the idea for a helicopter one day while watching fireflies fly vertically. Had Igor or the many other innovators like him not constantly been observing the world around them associating objects to come up with novel thoughts, many groundbreaking inventions would have never come to fruition. Innovators are constantly networking themselves and their ideas. Creating a strong web of social connections, not only helps you gain the knowledge of those around you, but it also allows you to fully execute on the potential of your ideas. When a great idea or invention has been created, oftentimes it will never receive the attention or funding that is required to make it become successful. Had Steve Jobs not had the ability to network himself and show other the potential of the personal computer, it is very unlikely that Apple would exist today along with the innovations that it has brought to society. The last crucial way that innovators think is that they are always experimenting with new ideas and inventions in order to find something that works. Coupled with close observation, experimentation can prove to be extremely helpful when trying to solve the important questions innovators have. Elon Musk, when trying to figure out how to make a rocket that could land, experimented on rocket design with his company SpaceX many times before he was able to catch his big break with a billion-dollar NASA contract.</p>

								<!--<h3>Synthesis</h3>-->
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">
										As we already may know, Moore's law is accelerating the power of computing speed that is becoming available making way for new innovations. One such company that is taking full advantage of such technology is Amazon. Currently, Amazon employs over 125,000 full-time warehouse employees that keep shipments of the items being delivered on the website in and out. However, they are planning on streamlining this process by removing humans altogether from their warehouses. Higher ups at Amazon are saying that fully automated warehouses are ten years away. This fits very well into the current trend of workplace innovation; As time goes on companies are able to generate increasingly large amounts of revenue using less and less human workers. Much like their other silicon valley counterparts, such as Facebook, Amazon is beginning to learn how they can service billions of customers using only a couple thousand humans as opposed to the millions that would have been required in the years prior. Although Amazon doesn’t outright say that they will be firing these 125,000 warehouse employees, it is extremely likely that if these workers are unable to train themselves in skills that are hard to automate, they will eventually be laid off. When looking at the trend of workplace automation, it becomes extremely clear as to how important it is to teach creativity and innovation, the two biggest skills that computers are unlikely to be able to learn how to do anytime in the near future. Being taught how to conform to the rules and be obedient has only produces workers that aren’t being needed in today's evolving workspace.

								<h3>How can I more effectively innovate? </h3>
								<p>...</p>
								<h3>How can I more effectively adapt to accelerating change and innovation cycles?</h3>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">One of the things that I will do in order to prepare for future change is I will make sure that I acquire as many skills that are hard to automate as possible in order to ensure that I can compete in a future job market dominated by automation. The second thing that I will continue to do in the future is to learn languages in order to ensure that I have the ability to work with a broad group of people in different markets around the world. Lastly, I will try to create a strong network of people around me. With a strong network, I will be able to not only get key insight about important news, but I will be able to have a safety net to bounce back on in case something happens.</p>
								<h3>What does Steve Jobs teach me about creativity and career success? </h3>
								<p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">One of the largest lessons that I learned from Steve Job’s career at Apple and his life is that you need to truly love what you in order to ensure that you will be successful in your career. During his Stanford commencement speech, Jobs talks about how he was able to continue his work at Apple regardless of the fact that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer due to the fact that he did every day what he wanted to do his last day alive. Another big lesson learned from Steve Jobs is that you can’t be afraid to fail and you can’t let the market dictate where you want your business to go. Despite countless failures such as Lisa and the Macintosh, Jobs kept going until he struck gold on the iPod and then several years later with the iPhone.</p>
